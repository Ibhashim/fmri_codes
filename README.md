# fmri_codes
This is a repository storing code I am writing during my research masters in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands.

fmri_single_trial_fit
This code is my rewrite of a MATLAB code by one of my supervisors at university. 

The code returns the beta and T value for the fit of the voxel and hrf time courses. It takes as input two lists; the voxel time course and the hrf time course. 

The code is 1/100 the speed of the MATLAB code. If anyone has a suggestion on how to improve the speed of the code I would love to hear!
